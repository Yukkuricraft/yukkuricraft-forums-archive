    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      What you are looking at is an archive of the Yukkuricraft forums. Throughout the years, the forums saw less use,
      as the community moved to Discord. The forums themselves were also unstable, and fell into disrepair in time, so
      we made an archive of the contents they once contained here. They have been preserved both because they still
      contain useful information to reference, and because linkrot is a sad thing which is nice when can be avoided.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please note that the forums are archived as they were after we made them read only. Not all information, like
      staff roles will be up to date.
